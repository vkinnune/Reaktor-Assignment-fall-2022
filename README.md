# Reaktor-Assignment-fall-2022

This project was a medium difficulty parsing problem. Our task was to do a small program that takes a poetry.lock file as input and showcases some key information in an HTML user interface.

## Usage
Run `make`.

And then with `./poetry-parser poetry.lock > index.html`.

Open the html on your web browser.

The solution is hosted on my Heroku: https://reaktor-assignment-fall-2022.herokuapp.com/
